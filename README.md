# Project Title: GitHub CLI Wrapper

A comprehensive command-line interface wrapper for GitHub API endpoints.

## Description
I built this to provide a user-friendly and efficient way to interact with GitHub repositories, issues, pull requests, releases, and more from the comfort of your terminal. This project aims to simplify the process of performing common GitHub actions using intuitive commands.

## Features

* Clone and fork repositories with a single command
* Create, update, and delete repositories, including details and collaborators
* Publish, archive, and backup repositories with ease
* Manage releases, issues, pull requests, and collaborator assignments
* Run, disable, and enable GitHub Actions workflows for seamless CI/CD integration

One cool feature is the ability to manage GitHub Pages directly from the command line!

## Installation

1. Clone this repository: `git clone https://github.com/YOUR-USERNAME/github-cli-wrapper.git`
2. Navigate into the project directory: `cd github-cli-wrapper`
3. Install dependencies using pip: `pip install -r requirements.txt` (Note: You'll need Python and pip installed on your system)
4. Run the wrapper with Python: `python main.py`

## Usage

Consult the code for a comprehensive list of available commands and their usage.

| Command | Description |
| --- | --- |
| `--create <repo_name>` | Create a new repository |
| `--publish <full_path>` | Publish an existing repository |

You get the idea!

## Contributing

Contributions are welcome! If you'd like to add or modify features, please:

1. Fork this repository
2. Make your changes and commit them with meaningful messages
3. Submit a pull request for review

I'm thinking about adding...

* Support for GitHub APIs beyond v4
* Integration with other version control systems (e.g., GitLab, Bitbucket)
